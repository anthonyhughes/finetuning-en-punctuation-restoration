Tolkien drew on a wide array of influences including language, Christianity, mythology including the Norse VÃ¶lsunga saga, archaeology, especially at the Temple of Nodens, ancient and modern literature, and personal experience. He was inspired primarily by his profession, philology; his work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially Beowulf, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings.
